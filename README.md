### Description

This sample project demonstrates uses of ADO not covered in the preceding topic. The sample project presented here is a simple "one-table" database application. It works with a table of customer data (name, address, phone, etc.) and allows the user to view, add, update, and delete customer records. This sample project uses a DSN-less connection (compared to the Intro to ADO Part 1 tutorial which used DSN). Also, this sample project uses the ListView control to display the records that the application will be working with. A tutorial on the use of the ListView control is covered at the end of the article.
